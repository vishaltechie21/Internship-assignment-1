# 🚀 Assignment: Basic CRUD API (Beginner Level)

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this assignment is to **understand the complete flow of building an API from scratch**.
You will create a very basic **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API** using **Node.js and Express**, document your learning, and submit your own report.

This is **not about perfection**.
It is about **clarity, exploration, and learning by doing**.

---

## 🧠 What You Will Learn

* How to start a Node.js project from zero
* How to set up an Express server
* How APIs work (request → response)
* How CRUD operations are designed
* How to test APIs using Postman
* How to document your work clearly

---

## 📦 Tech Stack

* Node.js
* Express.js
* JavaScript
* Postman (for testing)

*No database is required. Use an in-memory array.*

---

## 🗂️ Project Setup

### 1️⃣ Create a New Project Folder

```bash
mkdir basic-crud-api
cd basic-crud-api
```

### 2️⃣ Initialize Node.js Project

```bash
npm init -y
```

### 3️⃣ Install Express

```bash
npm install express
```

---

## 📁 Project Structure

```text
basic-crud-api/
│
├── index.js        # Main server file
├── package.json
└── README.md
```

---

## ▶️ Starting the Server

Create a file called `index.js` and start with:

* Import Express
* Create an app
* Add one test route
* Start the server on port `3000`

Run the server using:

```bash
node index.js
```

If everything is correct, you should see:

```
Server running on port 3000
```

---

## 🧪 API Requirements

You must create the following endpoints:

### ➕ Create

* Add a new record to an array

### 📖 Read

* Get all records
* Get a single record by ID

### ✏️ Update

* Update a record using ID

### ❌ Delete

* Remove a record using ID

Use **JSON** for request and response bodies.

---

## 🧑‍💻 Data Model (Example)

```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "John Doe",
  "age": 22
}
```

---

## 🔍 Testing the API

Use **Postman** to test:

* GET
* POST
* PUT
* DELETE

Make sure:

* You understand what each request does
* You can explain the request body and response

---

## 📝 Assignment Rules

* Everyone must create **their own repository**
* Everyone must write **their own report**
* Copy-paste without understanding is discouraged
* Add comments wherever you feel confused

---

## 📄 Report Guidelines

Your report should include:

1. Project setup steps
2. API endpoints explanation
3. Problems you faced
4. How you solved them
5. What you learned

---

## ✅ Submission Checklist

* [ ] GitHub repository link
* [ ] Working server
* [ ] All CRUD APIs implemented
* [ ] README.md updated
* [ ] Personal report completed

---

## 🌱 Final Note

This assignment is a **foundation stone**.
Go slow. Break things. Fix them. Learn deeply.

If you can **explain your code**, you have already succeeded. 💡

Happy building 👨‍💻👩‍💻
